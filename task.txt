Assignment:

-> Create a simple REST NodeJS server to store list of ToDos for users
-> The assginment needs to be uploaded on Git
-> Use of some version control tool to commit/save the application


Users -> '/users':
	- create a new user
	- get list of all users
		-- Example for format (https://private-49af4-nodejstest.apiary-mock.com/users)

Todos '/Users/{id}/todos'
	- Get list of Todos for a user
		-- Example of format (https://private-49af4-nodejstest.apiary-mock.com/users/1/todos)
	- Create a new todos for a user
	- Update a todos list item
	- Delete a todos list item

Save the data in a persistent storage using a NoSQL database like MongoDb	
	- You can use Mongodb instance running on your local machine
	- Else can use the below link in your code's connection to point to a hosted mongodb instance
		-- mongodb://test:test@ds147799.mlab.com:47799/snow_nodejs_mongo_test

User authorisation check logic for user Edit and Delete of a post (Only users who own a todo list item can edit/delete it)

Validations on the request data

Use of NPM to install the dependencies for project (package.json file need to be uploaded too)

Use of a Async logging package for logging

Use a promise library in the code

Import/Require Mocha/Chai and Nodemon packages for Testing and Development related activities. Some test cases using same would be welcome

Run server on port other than default port

How would you run server on HTTPS. Comment code for running on HTTPS

If more details are required, can visit a demo API document page created for the server which needs to be created by Examinee. Doumentation page also has mock server is more details about payload required.
